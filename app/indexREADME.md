// state
// lifecycle events ( allows you to hook into differnt lifecycle moments in a component )
// I want to run this component when data is loads to the DOM
// UI ( shown with a render method )

// It looks like we are combining HTML AND JS!! Separation of concerns
// A component is HTML and JS and CSS
// When babel transforms the JSX it will be JS anyways

#### Forms:

idea of controlled vs uncontrolled components

- think in terms of encapsulation of state when you capture the state or input in a nested component
- pass a funciton down to grab that piece of state
